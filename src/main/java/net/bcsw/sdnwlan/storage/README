# storage - Persistent (and distributed) storage data
###########################################################

This directory contains interfaces and classes concerned with the saving
and restoring of access point information to persistent and
strongly consistent distributed store.

TODO Should we create a separate topic for hosts and make it eventually consistent for preformance???

----------------------------------------------------------
On startup, the suggested sequence of events should be:

1. Restore information from the persistent storage location (may be empty)

2. Read in any configuration file.  Using a unique identifier for each item
   being restored (say MAC address for an Access Point), update any existing
   data (perhaps from step 1) with this data.

   For this purposes, it is suggested that most AP/host information in a
   configuration file be empty for an actual deployment.

3. Register any appropriate host and device listeners

4. Walk existing topology and look for any new access points or hosts of
   interest.  Devices are of greatest importance since we do not know if
   a host in the topology is a mobile host until we have read its access
   point (device) in.

   During this period, hosts and device events may occur.  The fun here will
   be experimenting and figuring out the best thing to do.

5. We are initialized.  Treat host/device events appropriately.  Hopefully
   few Access Point device add/remove events will occur compared to mobile
   host events.
